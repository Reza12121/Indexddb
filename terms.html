<strong>Investigator:</strong> Reza Ebrahimi<br />
<strong>Contact Information:</strong> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5022352a313532103534257e3131257e3124">[email&#160;protected]</a><br />
<strong>Title of Research Study:</strong> Quality of Experience Evaluation of ABR Schemes, Stall Events, and Quality Switches in Game Streaming<br />
<strong>Sponsor:</strong> Athena-CD<br />
<strong>Introduction</strong><br />
We are asking you to participate in a research study. You must be fully advised about the study’s objective, the methods to be followed, and any benefits, risks, or discomfort you may experience as a result of participating. Please fill out this form so you can make an informed decision regarding your participation in the study.<br />
<strong>Purpose of the study:</strong><br />
Throughout this study, stall events and quality switching will be examined in the context of three popular game genres, as well as game-paced speed in game streaming.<br />
<strong>Procedures to be followed:</strong><br />
You will be asked to take part in our three different experiments, Stall Event vs. Quality Level Switch Evaluation (SvQ), Longer Stall Events vs. Short Stall Events Evaluation (SSvLS), and Quality Level Switch Evaluation (QS) by watching the streaming designed for less than one minute each. You will also be asked to answer the surveys. The test would last approximately ten minutes for each experiment. A selection of three video gameplays has been made from the most famous commercial games on Twitch. As an example, in QvS, the games will take place in 30-second rounds. We will alter the quality switching and stalling to simulate changes in the network fluctuation during each round. Upon completion of each round, you will be asked to complete a short five-question survey regarding your overall experience. Upon completion of each video streaming round, we will switch to another gameplay stream..<br />
<strong>Risks to study participants:</strong><br />
One of the games features many bright, fast moving colors. If you are prone to epileptic seizures, please do not participate in this study. Additionally, while we will be taking precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, there is still the risk of it spreading during one of our tests.<br />
<strong>Benefits to research participants and others:</strong><br />
Participation in this study is associated with completing MTurk tasks. Please refer to the Cost/Payment section for details on compensation.<br />
<strong>Record keeping and confidentiality:</strong><br />
Additionally, we will record measures of responses to the surveys. During the game streaming, we will not be recording anything else.<br />
As far as permitted by law, records of your participation in this study will remain confidential. The data will not be published or presented in a way that would identify you or your ID in MTurk.<br />
<strong>Compensation or treatment in the event of injury:</strong><br />
You do not surrender any legal rights by signing this experiment test.<br />
<strong>Cost/Payment:</strong><br />
After you’ve completed and submitted the HIT, your work will be reviewed. When it is approved, you will be paid for each campaign identified in MTurk.<br />
<strong>Your participation in this research is voluntary</strong><br />
Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty to you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. You may decide to stop participating in the research at any time without penalty or loss of other benefits. The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit.<br />
<strong>By signing below</strong> if you refuse to participate, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. It is your right to discontinue participation in the research at any time without penalty or loss of benefits. During the course of the project, the investigators retain the right to postpone or cancel the experimental procedures as they deem appropriate.</p>
