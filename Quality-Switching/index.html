      <h1>Quality Switching Evaluation Survey</h1>
      <p style style=”line-height: 200%”> <b>Introduction:</b>Thank you for participating in the game streaming survey campaign. A survey study conducted to determine the game streaming QoE based on
        stall events and quality switching. We have designed three campaigns: Quality Switching vs. Stall Events QvS, Short Stalls vs.
        Long Stalls (SSvsLS), and Quality Switching (QS).<br> <b>Instruction:</b>Three video game streams will be played for one minute, followed by three related questions.
        After each video has been streamed, questions will be asked. Videos can only be viewed after they have been loaded. The test would last approximately ten minutes for
        each experiment. <br> <b>Consent Agreement:</b> We will record measures of responses to the surveys. During the game streaming, we will not be recording anything else.
        As far as permitted by law, records of your participation in this study will remain confidential. The data will not be published or presented in a way that would identify
        you or your ID in MTurk. Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty to you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. You may decide
        to stop participating in research at any time without liability or loss of other benefits. The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental
        procedures at any time they see fit.
